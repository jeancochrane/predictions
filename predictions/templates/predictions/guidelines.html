    2021 is the fifth year we’ve hosted predictions for New Year’s Eve,
    and we’ve learned a few things about what makes for a good game.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Do</strong> make predictions about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Celebrities</strong> (Who will get canceled? Who will get divorced? Who will come out as an anti-vaxxer? etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>Trends</strong> (What will be the new oat milk? Which ‘00s looks will come back in style? What activity will everyone get into this year? etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>Politics/world events</strong> (What gaffes will Biden make? What unintended consequences will emerge from Brexit? What will be the next pandemic-induced shortage? etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>Niche/local issues</strong> (What campaign promise will Lori Lightfoot break next? What West Philly business will get boycotted? What drama will engulf the beauty Youtuber community? etc.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Don't</strong> make predictions about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Yourself, your friends, or inside jokes</strong> most people won’t understand (“Liz will knit a sweater this year,” “Jean gets into ice-fishing,” etc.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Other tips and guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Keep it short!</strong> Imagine you’re writing a headline&mdash;get the idea across in one sentence or phrase (maybe even one word!)</li>
    <li><strong>Keep it fun!</strong> It’s been an especially dark year, and while it’s OK to make predictions about the pandemic and other current events, try not to spiral too much into doomsday scenarios.</li>
    <li><strong>Punch up, not down!</strong> Dark humor and satire are welcome, but remember that while it’s fun to joke about bad things happening to powerful people, it’s not fun to muse about bad things happening to regular people or vulnerable communities.</li>
